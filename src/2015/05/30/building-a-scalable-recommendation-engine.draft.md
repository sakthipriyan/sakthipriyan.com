###Intro

Now a days recommendation engines are everywhere trying to suggest relevant things.
Recommendation engine is usually built on top of insights data. Insights are generated as follows.

* Data is ingested, cleaned, enriched and standardized in required format.
* Various algorithms are run on top this data to produce output.
* Insights data is created based on the output produced by algorithms.

In short, insights are generated by the algorithms from the standardized data.

###Goals

* Recommendation engine, responding in few milliseconds.
* Horizontally scalable system. Add more nodes to increase capacity.
* Easy to scale up or down based on the data requirement.
