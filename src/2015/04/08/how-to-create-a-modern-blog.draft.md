How to create a modern blog?
using markdown and python
blog software, webgen, design, python

Over past few years I had tried various blogging platforms, say Live journal, wordpress (self hosted as well), tumblr, microsoft sharepoint etc., Everyone of these had only browser based editors. I was looking for simple text file based blogging software. I came across [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). But, instead of learning it, I wondered why don't I create simple one. 

###Primary Goals

1. Write blog using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
2. Code highlighting.
3. Responsive UI.
4. Tagging posts.
5. List blogs by date.
6. Share link over social media.
